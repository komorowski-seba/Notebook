The idea for this app/tutorail came from the fact that I once struggled with a unity application that had to use JWT and oAuth2 tokens. With this project, I can save someone some time and trouble - i think. The whole of this project is a simple application to create and display notes. To display notes, the user logs into the application, they can add and view their notes
